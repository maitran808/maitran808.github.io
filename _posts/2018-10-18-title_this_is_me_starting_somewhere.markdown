Newbie, Newb, New Guy, New Gal...everyone starts somewhere. 

I needed change. Unhappy with my current career I wanted to be able to work in a flexible remote work environment while doing something I enjoyed. Working fulltime in digital marketing really opened my eyes to a whole new world of technology.  Even though I was already familiar with a different kind of engineering, the nerd in me fell in love with trying to figure out how things were designed on websites and software.

I was unhappy doing social media marketing. It seemed as though it was draining me of all sense of reality. I suddenly wanted everything in my life to be a lot less cluttered with a path that felt less noisy. One of my coworkers wanted to learn how to code, so I decided to join her on the adventure. As I dipped my toe into an online course on Codecademy,  I was hooked. This was it.  For the first time in a very long time, I was actually enjoying learning something that I could change my career to.  Not to mention getting paid more but that is definitely a bonus!

Months went by as I tried to find a school that best suit my needs. I wanted to do it all. I talked to a few hiring managers to make sure I wasn't wasting my time going to a school vs. University.  Or vice versa. Someone once said to me if I want to get hired it's not about where you learned it from but it's about what you can do. Flatiron School had been on my radar for quite some time so I decided to do the bootcamp. The layout was incredible. I didn't feel rushed and I felt that if I left a lesson, I could easily pick right up where I left. When can I sign up?! I never felt rushed or hurried in the application and enrollment process and so I knew this was going to be a great fit. 

Here I am now. Enrolled at Flatiron School. This is me starting somewhere.
